# Instagram Setup Guide for Clients

If you want to use Instagram posting features, you **must** complete this setup first. This is required by Instagram/Meta and cannot be bypassed.

## Step 1: Convert Your Instagram to Business Account

**On your phone (Instagram app):**

1. Open Instagram
2. Go to your **Profile** → **Settings** (☰ menu) → **Account**
3. Tap **Switch to Professional Account**
4. Select **Business** (not Creator)
5. Complete the setup wizard

## Step 2: Connect Instagram to Facebook Page

**Important**: You need a Facebook Page for your business. If you don't have one, create one at https://www.facebook.com/pages/create

### Option A: Connect via Instagram (Mobile - Easiest)

1. In Instagram, go to **Settings** → **Business** → **Facebook Page**
2. Tap **Connect a Facebook Page**
3. Select your Facebook Page
4. Confirm the connection

### Option B: Connect via Facebook (Desktop)

1. Go to https://www.facebook.com/
2. Open your Facebook Page
3. Go to **Settings** → **Instagram** (in the left sidebar)
4. Click **Connect Account**
5. Enter your Instagram username and password
6. Confirm the connection

## Step 3: Verify the Connection

1. Go to your Facebook Page on Facebook.com
2. Check **Page Settings** → **Instagram**
3. You should see your Instagram account listed
4. Status should show "Connected" or "Active"

## Step 4: Authorize the App

1. After your Instagram is connected to your Facebook Page
2. Continue with the app's authorization flow
3. Authorize the app to access your Facebook Page
4. The app will automatically detect and connect to your Instagram

## Troubleshooting

### "Instagram Business Account not found"
- Make sure you converted your Instagram to a Business account (Step 1)
- Make sure your Instagram is connected to your Facebook Page (Step 2)
- Verify the connection in Facebook Page settings

### "No Instagram account linked to this Facebook page"
- Your Instagram account is not connected to the Facebook Page
- Follow Step 2 to connect them
- Then try authorizing again

### "Can't find my Facebook Page"
- Create a Facebook Page first at https://www.facebook.com/pages/create
- Then connect your Instagram to it

## Important Notes

- **This is required by Meta/Instagram** - there's no way around it
- The Instagram account must be a **Business** or **Creator** account (not personal)
- The connection must be done **before** authorizing the app
- You can disconnect and reconnect anytime from Instagram settings

## Questions?

If you're having trouble, check:
1. Is your Instagram account set to Business?
2. Is your Instagram connected to a Facebook Page?
3. Is the Facebook Page the same one you're authorizing in the app?

If yes to all three and it still doesn't work, contact support.
